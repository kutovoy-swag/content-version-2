## Universal Skill

**Skill:** `.claude/skills/reels/` — universal vertical content skill

When calling skill `reels`, the vertical content creation methodology loads.

---

## Working with Projects

When working with a specific project — **load its CLAUDE.md** for context:

```
projects/[project]/CLAUDE.md → project specifics
```

Project specifics (audience, tone, Notion database, languages) — always in the project folder.

## 200 Million Test

> Short must ALWAYS reach the maximum wide audience

### PASS if:
- Relates to ALL people of a certain category
- Universal fear/desire/interest
- Specific product/action (not abstraction)

### FAIL if:
- Only for people with specific diagnosis/status
- Too narrow subgroup
- Requires special knowledge to understand

**Examples:**
```
❌ "Why freelancers shouldn't work from home" — only freelancers
✅ "Work from home? Here's what happens to your back" — all remote workers

❌ "How to treat chronic gastritis" — only those with diagnosis
✅ "This food destroys your stomach after 30" — everyone 30+
```

## Script Structure (20-60 sec)

### Short format (20-25 sec)
```
Hook (3-5 sec)      — Statement, NOT question
Intrigue (5-7 sec)  — Amplify, answer hidden
Reveal (5-7 sec)    — Answer
Action (3-5 sec)    — What to do
```

### Medium format (40-60 sec)
```
Hook (3-5 sec)      — VISP opening
Setup (10-15 sec)   — Problem amplification
Content (20-30 sec) — Main value (list/story/explanation)
CTA (5-10 sec)      — Action + subscribe
```

---

## Retention Killers

1. **Answer in first seconds** — main killer
2. **Multiple topics** — 1 clip = 1 problem
3. **Question instead of statement** — statement is stronger
4. **Monotonous visuals** — need subtitles/cutaways
5. **Long lists** — maximum 5 points, better 3

---

## AI Voiceover Rules

If content is voiced by AI (HeyGen etc.):

- **NO** quotation marks
- **ALL** numbers as words
- **NO** staccato ("Pain. Fatigue. Weakness.")
- **NO** hypophora (question + own answer)
- Sentences up to 20 words
- Smooth transitions

```
❌ "Warm water. Not hot. Not cold. Warm."
✅ "Use warm water, somewhere between room temperature and hot."
```

## CTA — Where to Place

| Location | When |
|-------|-------|
| NOT at beginning | Haven't shown value yet |
| In the middle | After first solid value |
| Before #1 in top list | Ideal placement |
| At the end | After all value |

---

## Success Metrics

| Metric | Standard | Goal |
|---------|-------|------|
| 3+ sec retention | 60% | 70%+ |
| Full watch-through | 40% | 50%+ |
