### Elements

| Element | Position | Purpose |
|---------|----------|---------|
| Expert/Doctor | Right 1/3 | Authority, trust |
| Trigger Text | Top or center-left | Hook, curiosity |
| Impulse Object | Left 1/3 | Visual anchor |
| Arrow/Pointer | Between elements | Direction, connection |
| Background | Full frame | Context, mood |

### Rules

- **Max 3 objects** (expert + text + impulse object)
- **Max 3 colors** (brand + accent + neutral)
- **Text: 2-5 words** on colored box
- **Readable at 14% scale** (mobile sidebar)
- **Aspect ratio: 16:9** (1920x1080 or 1280x720)

---

## Template A: Expert + Impulse Object (TEXT)

```
A professional YouTube thumbnail image in 16:9 aspect ratio (1920x1080 pixels).

RIGHT SIDE (40%): A [age] [ethnicity] male doctor with [hair description] wearing [clothing], displaying [emotion expression] with [pose detail]. Face clearly visible, taking up significant portion of the right third.

LEFT SIDE (40%): [Impulse object description] with [visual treatment: golden circle border / red arrow pointing / red X overlay / green checkmark / subtle glow]. Object is prominent and immediately recognizable.

TEXT: Large bold text reading "[TRIGGER TEXT]" (maximum 5 words) on a [dark red #8B0000 / bright orange #FF6600] rectangular box with slight drop shadow, positioned [top-left / center-top]. White text, bold sans-serif font (Impact style), readable at small sizes.

BACKGROUND: [Dark blue gradient with subtle molecular formulas / Bright gradient yellow-to-orange / Blurred medical office]. Clean, not competing with foreground elements.

STYLE: High contrast, vibrant colors, professional medical channel aesthetic. Sharp focus on face and objects. Optimized for small display sizes.
```

---

## Template B: Face Swap (with reference)

```
Replace the person in [Image1] with the person from [Image2].

IDENTITY PRESERVATION (CRITICAL):
- Preserve EXACT facial features from [Image2]: bone structure, nose shape, eye spacing, jawline
- Preserve EXACT skin tone, texture, pores, any blemishes
- Preserve EXACT hairstyle, hair color, hairline
- NO beautification, NO smoothing, NO idealization
- NO age change, NO ethnicity drift
- Person MUST be 100% recognizable as the same individual from [Image2]

SCENE PRESERVATION:
- Keep ALL text overlays, graphic elements, and background from [Image1] unchanged
- Keep the exact composition and layout from [Image1]
- Match lighting direction and color temperature naturally

OUTPUT: Professional YouTube thumbnail, 16:9 aspect ratio. The result should look like the real person ([Image2]) was photographed in the thumbnail scene ([Image1]).
```

## Emotion Library

| Emotion | Prompt Description | Use When |
|---------|-------------------|----------|
| **Shocked** | "eyes wide open, eyebrows raised high, mouth slightly open in surprise" | Revealing secrets, myth-busting |
| **Thinking** | "hand on chin, slight head tilt, contemplative expression, one eyebrow raised" | Analysis, comparisons |
| **Concerned** | "furrowed brow, slight frown, serious expression, worried eyes" | Warning content, problems |
| **Confident** | "direct eye contact, slight knowing smile, shoulders back" | Solutions, protocols |
| **Happy** | "genuine smile showing teeth, warm expression, relaxed posture" | Positive results, success |
| **Skeptical** | "one eyebrow raised, slight smirk, head tilted, questioning look" | Debunking, truth reveals |
| **Urgent** | "intense gaze, leaning forward, finger pointing, emphatic expression" | Must-know information |

---

## Object Arrangements

### Visual Treatments

| Treatment | Prompt Description | Use For |
|-----------|-------------------|---------|
| **Golden Circle** | "surrounded by a golden circular border with subtle glow" | Highlighting good items |
| **Red Arrow** | "large red arrow pointing at the object from above-left" | Drawing attention |
| **Red X** | "large red X overlay on the object" | Warning, avoid |
| **Green Checkmark** | "green checkmark next to the object" | Approved, recommended |
| **Subtle Glow** | "soft glowing aura around the object" | Emphasis |
| **Circular Frame** | "object placed inside a white circular frame with shadow" | Clean presentation |

### Multi-Object Arrangement

```
For 2-3 impulse objects, arrange in:
- Horizontal row (objects side by side)
- Diagonal cascade (top-left to bottom-right)
- Overlapping circles (each object in its own circle)

Example: "Three food items (tomato, beet, pumpkin seeds) arranged in overlapping circles, left-to-right, each in a white circular frame with golden border"
```
